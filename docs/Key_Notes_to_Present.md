# Key Notes to Present

## Plan

1. Very clear vulnerability. Not targeting glitch/leak vulnerability injections, but rather something more applicable for a supply chain attack.
2. Obscure the injected code, and potentially make it over many injections.
3. All tests, in their original states, _must_ continue to pass.
4. We do not care about LUTs/footprint. We will use only registers to add this extra logic.
5. Not a theoretical vulnerability. Very real injection.

## Techniques

* Start new/fresh chats with ChatGPT. Make it focus on only what you're giving it.
* Try the exact prompt multiple times. If it's not giving the same answer on a factual or opinion question (e.g., where to target), you might not be giving it enough info.
    * E.g., prompt it with summaries instead of `du -a` listing.
